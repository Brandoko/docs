## Install

ðŸ’¡ **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn
```

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ yarn start-renderer-dev
$ yarn start-main-dev
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `START_MINIMIZED=true`:

```bash
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn dev
```
